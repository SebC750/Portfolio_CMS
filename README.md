# Sandbox Repo

## Overview

This repository was created to showcase my learning experiences with new technologies (C#, Swift and Typescript) and writing general stuff in languages I already know and use (Java and Python). This repository includes a collection of different programs written in various languages.
I intended to show here my thought process regarding how I implement code and write programs. I also want to show my understanding of sorting and searching algorithms with different data structures in each language. 
I am always simultaneously learning new things and refining existing knowledge to stay on top of my game and build a vast skillset that helps me to be flexible in adapting different technologies when needed. 
Whether I am testing out features of a programming language, writing a simple program to understand a design pattern better or just generally screwing around, I will be updating this repository constantly.

## Languages that I already know
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Java 
- Python
- Ruby (Passing familiarity with it, particularly in conducting unit testing with RSpec and ensuring that controllers are sending data to routes)

## Technologies i am currently learning
- Typescript
- Next.js
- Express.js
- PHP
